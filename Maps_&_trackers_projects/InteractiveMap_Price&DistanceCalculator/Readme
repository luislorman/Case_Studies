Hello,

This code is created with the intention that the user enters a location (town and postcode)
and the type of product being transported. An interactive map is displayed along with a new DF showing a list of distances between the user's input and the company's locations (random locations).
This DF is sorted by closest location and price. 

The map will have 3 different labels:
Blue: company location (not real)
Green: user's input
Purple: it contains information about the distance of that particular Blue label and the user's input.

Best regards,
Luis
