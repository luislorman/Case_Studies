Case Study of a Hotel dataset from Kaggle.

Context
The online hotel reservation channels have dramatically changed booking possibilities and customersâ€™ behavior. 
A significant number of hotel reservations are called-off due to cancellations or no-shows. 
The typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. 
This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost which is beneficial to hotel guests
but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with.


My goal:
Searching business insights and try to find interesting profiles/facts for the business.
